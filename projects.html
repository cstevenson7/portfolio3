            <h1>BIO</h1>
            <p> I am a full stack Python developer, who for the last three years has been working as a GIS Techincian\Analyst. I realized that the GIS projects that I enjoyed the most were the ones that involved Python coding. <br>
            <br>
            Due to COVID 19, I was laid off in May this year and decided to take advantage of this break by enrolling in the Full Stack Developer course from Coding Temple.<br>
            <br>

            This course has improved my Python coding skills and intoduced me to Flask, JavaScript, Bootstrap, React, Angular and the data analysis Python modules of pandas, numpy and Matplotlib.<br>
            <br>
            When I am not working, you can find in the mountains.</p>
